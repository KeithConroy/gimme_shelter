# GimmeShelter

Providing a platform for non profit animal shelters to have a strong online presence
To assist in the process of finding animals a good home

## Overview

Shelters will create an account which will be accessible by a unique subdomain.  The account can be populated with profiles of all shelter animals.  Employees can add, update and mark animals as adopted.

Potential adopters can go to specific shelter sites, or the main site which will be populated with animals from all shelters on the platform.  They can search by species, breed, gender, size, age and so on.  They can inquire about animals through the website or see the shelters contact info.

Future goals:
- online adoption applications
- volunteer applications/management
- fundraising/donations
- lost animal support
- blogs/articles
